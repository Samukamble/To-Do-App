ArrayList is taking the input which is entered by the user in EditText and ArrayAdapter will bring the input to the listView. With the ArrayApadter the text is visible to the user. These two play a key role in the making of a todo list application.  Assigning the referring ids of elements to created objects.  Call the onClick function to add the Values.  In the onClick function, the condition is applied and the concept of Toast is used. If the entered element already exists in the list, the Toast will display a message "Item Already Exist". If the element does not exist it will enter the value.  Call the OnItemLongClick function to remove the Values from the list.  In OnItemLongClick, the concept of AlertDialog is used. It is used to get the confirmation from the user whether they want to delete the item from the list. If the user will enter on "OK", then the item will be removed from the list else on the click on "Cancel" it will return null.
